# Jupyter AI

Welcome to Jupyter AI, which brings generative AI to Jupyter. Jupyter has always been focused on enabling
humans to interact with code and data, and with the advent of generative AI, we're now able to use natural language
to further enhance this experience. Jupyter AI offers:

* An `%%ai` magic that turns the Jupyter notebook into a reproducible generative AI playground.
* A native UI in JupyterLab, enabling you to engage with generative AI as a conversational assistant.
* Support for a wide range of generative model providers and models
  (AI21, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, OpenAI, SageMaker, etc.).
