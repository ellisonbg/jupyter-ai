# Jupyter AI

Welcome to Jupyter AI, which brings generative AI to Jupyter. Jupyter AI provides a user-friendly 
and powerful way to explore generative AI in notebooks and use these models to accelerate
your work in JupyterLab and the Jupyter Notebook. More specifically, Jupyter AI offers:

* An `%%ai` magic that turns the Jupyter notebook into a reproducible generative AI playground.
  This works anywhere the IPython kernel runs (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VSCode, etc.).
* A native chat UI in JupyterLab that enables you to work with generative AI as a conversational assistant.
* Support for a wide range of generative model providers and models
  (AI21, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, OpenAI, SageMaker, etc.).
